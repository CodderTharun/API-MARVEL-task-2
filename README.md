# API-MARVEL-task-2-
It is the project to create the dynamic web interface using API

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows two software components to communicate using specific protocols and definitions. It typically works with a client-server model, where the client sends requests and the server provides responses. For this task, I created a weather app by using the OpenWeather API, along with HTML and JavaScript. The app fetches weather data from the API and displays it to the user based on their input, such as the city name. The development was guided by a tutorial video provided in the task.
